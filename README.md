## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
[![Udacity - Self-Driving Car NanoDegree](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/github/shield-carnd.svg)](http://www.udacity.com/drive)

Overview
---
In this project, I use what I've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. I trained and validated a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model was trained, I used my model to classify images with traffic signs that I found on the web.

We have included an Ipython notebook that contains implementation of my code and a writeup with summary of the results of this project. 

To meet specifications, the project contains following files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* the writeup report
* the writeup folder with images which were used in the report
* the model folder which contains trained model of my network
* the data folder with images which I found on the interned

### Dependencies
This lab requires:

* [CarND Term1 Starter Kit](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit)

The lab environment can be created with CarND Term1 Starter Kit. Click [here](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Term1-Starter-Kit/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

### Dataset 

Dataset might be downloaded directly to the /data/ folder or you can just start Ipython notebook file and it will be downloaded and unpacked automatically.
